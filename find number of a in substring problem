you are given with a string s such that string s has all small letters
this string s is repeated infinitly let number of times repeated be n
i.e let s=abac and n=10 then repeated string will be 'abacabacab' provided that you have to calculate the number of occurances os letter a in infinite
substring. 
remember that value of n can be 0<=n<=100000000000 (very important point to be noted)
let us see example
sample input 1:
aba
10
sample output:
7
explination : repeated string will be abaabaabaa number of occurance of 'a' is 7
