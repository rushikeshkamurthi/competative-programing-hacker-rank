A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left. For example, if  left rotations are performed on array[1,2,3,4,5] , then the array would become[3,4,5,1,2] .

Given an array 'a' of 'n' integers and a number 'd', , perform  'd' left rotations on the array. Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.

Function Description

Complete the function rotLeft in the editor below. It should return the resulting array of integers.

rotLeft has the following parameter(s):

An array of integers 'a' .
An integer 'd' , the number of rotations.


Output Format:
Print a single line of  space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing  left rotations.

Sample Input

5 4
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output

5 1 2 3 4

Explanation

When we perform d=4 left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:
